# Orianna Hibernate

Hibernate support for [Orianna](https://github.com/robrua/Orianna/).
 
## Setup

Just [download](https://github.com/robrua/orianna-hibernate/releases) the latest .jar and add it to your project's build path. You'll need to import the base Orianna resources as well.
 
To do this in eclipse, I recommend creating a lib/ directory in your project's root directory and putting the .jar there. Then just right click the .jar in eclipse and click Build Path -> Add to Build Path.

You can also find the latest SNAPSHOT build [here](http://robrua.com/orianna).

If you use Maven to manage your dependencies, Orianna Hibernate is posted on Maven Central:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.robrua</groupId>
  <artifactId>orianna-hibernate</artifactId>
  <version>2.2.5</version>
</dependency>
```

Or using Gradle:

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
	compile 'com.robrua:orianna-hibernate:2.2.5'
}
```

## Dependencies

Orianna Hibernate relies on [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/) v4.3.8.Final. It is included in the JARs distributed here.
 
## Usage

The HibernateDB is a DataStore as defined by Orianna. It is instantiated using either the builder pattern or a Hibernate configuration object.

The builder will use MySQL settings by default, though you'll need to include the [connector](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java) yourself. Any other hibernate-supported database can be used instead.

Make sure you close your DB when you're finished, as well as closing any iterators you may use.

```java
package com.robrua.orianna.test.core;

import com.robrua.orianna.api.core.RiotAPI;
import com.robrua.orianna.store.HibernateDB;
import com.robrua.orianna.type.core.common.Region;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RiotAPI.setMirror(Region.NA);
        RiotAPI.setRegion(Region.NA);
        RiotAPI.setAPIKey("YOUR-API-KEY-HERE");
        
        HibernateDB db = HibernateDB.builder().URL("jdbc:mysql://localhost/orianna").username("MYSQLUSER").password("MYSQLPASSWORD").build();
        RiotAPI.setDataStore(db);
        
        // Do your thing here. Data will be cached in the Hibernate DB as it would with the standard in-memory cache.
        
        db.close();
    }
}
```
